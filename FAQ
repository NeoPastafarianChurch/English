1. Are you atheists?

No, many of our congregation are atheists, but it is not required or officially promoted, NeoPastafarianism 
is concerned more with activism promoting secularism in politics, a skeptic approach to dubious factual 
claims, and the promotion of positive religious values that people from all walks of life can 
participate in. Given that the objectives somewhat political, drawing the ideological line in
concepts that cannot be resolved (ie Atheist/Agnostic/Deist debate) is detrimental to the groups 
objectives, it is better to define the organization around concepts that we all share.

2. But how can I believe in GOD and the Flying Spaghetti Monster?

Deists that participate in our Church have to be open minded, we believe that God, by definition omnipotent and
omnipresent, can present himsef in whatever form he wants us to perceive (if he ever has), and also, given 
the state that the world is in, he probably has a sense of humor.

3. Why the NEO in NeoPastafarian?

We embelish the Pastarian credo, our church started in Costa Rica, a country that borders the caribean
sea and once had pirate infested waters (please check the document our-credo for more information). 
We also exalt the importance of having a congregation of like-minded people that positively contributes 
to society. You could argue that our values go beyond the pastafarian of having a good time and 
drinking beer (not that there is anything wrong with that, mind you).

4. Why OpenSource?

Simple, we want to put a license in our credo and documents so that everybody can copy our church, 
but we want to put limits on how the church is organized, nobody should profit comercially from 
this idea, and accounting of the church should be transparent and open. We openly promote for all
of our congregation to participate in the development of our values and traditions, the only 
requirement being that our church document the proposals and the proponents justify them
based on scientific evidence, reasonable conjecture, or just simply fun. Proposals become
experiments (ie. do we celebrate Yom Kippur? would it be healthy for us?) that the church documents
and accepts or rejects. If you know the organization of opensource development, this scheme is exactly
the same.

5. Why a religion, don't you believe that religions are bad?

Many things in the world religions are bad, some of our congregation followers are antitheists for this
reason, but many things are also good, and it is crucial to separate the good from the bad.

Christianity for example, is responsible for the Holy Inquisition and countless other atrocities, 
but it also revolutionarily planted the seed two thousand years ago for the separation of church and 
state by statements made in the gospels such as: "Give to Ceasar what belongs to Ceasar, and to God 
what belongs to God" or "My kingdom is not of this world".

Islam is considered by many (mosty christians) as a religion that has stayed in the middle ages, yet
when it comes to stem cell research, or in vitro fertilization, they have no qualms, because Muslims
believe that the soul doesn't enter the body until after the baby is more that one month old.

We have to look closer at religions to separate good from bad. Religions are composed of the credo (dogma), 
values and traditions, aside from these some have philosophy and practice (ie Buddhism). When you analize
them it becomes evident that their problems come from their dogma, and how dogma makes societies and
people make irrational decisions.

As NeoPastafarians, we are commited to exposing this irrationality, and promoting the positive
aspects of the religious framework: values and traditions, so long as they do not conflict with scientific
evidence and a humane ethical framework. To achieve this NeoPastafarians adopt the Pastafarian maxim that
credo or dogma can be ignored, and asume the rule that dogma is not a legitimate basis for political
argument, decisions, or action.

6. Whats the deal with "Computational" Church?

Part of this question is already answered in the answer to question 4. But we do have a computational 
take on reality, please refer to the MumboJumbo document file for the philosophical mumbo jumbo. Many
of the followers of our congregation are computationally oriented, and we are developing a computer
language based on Pirate speak called Monesvol (just for the fun of it).

7. Do you really believe this S**t, or is this a Joke?

We do not emphasize the credo, but we do state that faith is irrational, and there is nothing wrong with
beleiving that the Flying Spaquetti Monster created the world 10,000 years ago and planted the evidence
for evolution and the big bang just to test our faith, so long as your social and political decisions are
consistent with the scientific evidence and you play along with the FSM joke (that the evidence he planted is
true, that is). Being rational and acting according to the evidence will not belittle your faith in the FSM,
and he will not hold it against you, just remember that faith and dogma are personal, and should not be used
for political decisions or social action. This begs the question: if someone really believes in the FSM why 
would he we follow the scientific evidence then? it is the only common ground that rational people with 
different belief systems have and the only way that they can reach accord and work together for a 
better society.

8. Are you mocking other religions (ie: Catholicism)?

We take some or our traditions from other religions, for example, we do communion with meatballs. This is
not out of mocking, but because we believe in taking what is good from other religions and adopting it,
many of our congregation come from a catholic background, and catholic communion is a very nice tradition.

While is not our intent to mock other religions, it is our intent to expose the absurdity of dogma though, 
and in the degree that other religions depend on dogma (ours included) then in that degree we will be referring 
to them (us). Dogma in and of itself is not the problem, the problem is the seriousness in which religions 
demand that people adopt their beliefs without evidence, and if not, the demand they pose on people to
respect them, most prominently Islam, but all other faiths to a larger and lesser degree.

If you do not agree with the beliefs that a religion proposes, it is not respect what you provide it when
you accept their ideas without questioning, it is submission. Respect is not an action but a mental
state, that cannot be asked or forced on the provider. Submission on the other hand, is accepting and
submitting to something that you do not agree with. 

As NeoPastafarians we believe submission is a very negative value and openly challege it with our beliefs 
and actions, in this issue we completely agree and recommend reading John Stewart Mill
(http://www.bartleby.com/130/2.html).

Many religions that request respect are actually asking for submission, because by having 
belief systems that are not defensible by argument the only way that they can defend themselves from rational
criticism is by suppresing it. They know, consciously or not, that like the emperors new clothes, if people 
start asking questions they will suddenly realize that they stand naked in the crowd.

9. Am I a NeoPastafarian then?

If you got here, then you probably are! but in a nutshell here are some guidelines

a. Enjoy life

b. Openly promote the happiness of all sentient beings

c. Do not take yourself too seriously

e. Have fun with the credo and the FSM (be outrageous)

d. Respect everyones right to believe whatever they want, so long as it doesn't affect others.

e. Do not respect what they believe if you think it doesn't make sense though, respect is for people,
not ideas.

f. Openly challenge beliefs that you think are absurt, intolerant or discriminatory.

g. Do not tolerate the tolerance of intolerance, it is the sin that corodes open societies from the inside.
